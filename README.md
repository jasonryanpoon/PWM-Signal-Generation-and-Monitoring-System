# PWM-Signal-Generation-and-Monitoring-System

Developed an embedded system for monitoring and controlling a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal that was generated by an external NE555 IC timer. The 4N35 IC external optocoupler driven by the microcontroller on the STMF0 Discovery board was used to control the frequency of the PWM signal, which was measured accordingly by the microcontroller. The microcontroller was also used to measure the voltage across the potentiometer on the PBMCUSLK board, consequently relaying it to the 4N35 for controlling the PWM signal frequency. Lastly, the measured frequency and POT resistance is displayed on the LCD on the PBMCUSLK board.
